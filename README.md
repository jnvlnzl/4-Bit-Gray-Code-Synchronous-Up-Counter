# 4-Bit-Gray-Code-Synchronous-Up-Counter

The project focuses on the use of Gray Code, a special binary numeral system where consecutive values differ by just one bit, to design and implement a 4-bit synchronous up counter. Because gray code is not weighted and is therefore independent of positional digit values, it is sometimes referred to as reflected binary code and has advantages in specific applications. Gray Code's cyclic property makes sure that changes from one value to the next only require a single bit to shift.
